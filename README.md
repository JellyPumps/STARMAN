# Starman's Odyssey
## You are (NOT) Alone. You wish you were.

A **PSX-style**, **First Person**, **Horror**, **Survival**, **Space Exploration** game taking place on **Europa**,
Jupiter's frozen moon.

After a catastrophic disaster, **Starman Orion Voss** and his scattered crew navigate the icy wasteland,
evade deadly radiation, and as uncover the truth beneath the icy, _It_ will watch.
